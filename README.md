## Game Mechanics

### Light Mode:

#### The game utilizes the player's keyboard inputs. pressing any of the arrow keys will move the player one step in their respective direction. All the player has to do is move around the maze until they find the right path to reach the other end. The only issue is, they have a set amount of time to finish the level; else, they lose.

### Nightmare Mode:

#### In nightmare mode, the players have to navigate through the maze again **_BUT_** now they can only see a small area around them. They have to use their memory to find the right path and get out before the time ends.
